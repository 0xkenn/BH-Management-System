Multi-auth BHMS is a Laravel-based system that supports four distinct user roles: Admin, School, Boarding House (BH) Owners, and Tenants. Each role has specific capabilities:

Tenants: Can reserve boarding houses, rate their experience, and provide feedback.
Boarding House Owners: Can create, read, update, and delete their own boarding house listings. Owners cannot log in until approved by the admin.
Schools: Can monitor and manage students based on their boarding house assignments.
Admin: Oversees the entire system, including user management, boarding house approvals, and maintaining platform functionality.
This system ensures a seamless and role-specific user experience while maintaining control and oversight through admin approvals and school monitoring. the search uses cosine similarity algorithm
